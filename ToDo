issues: 
basically my css for #secret takes hella long to load cos it re-renders the box-shadow with every name change 

banner easily select mascot n series
pull restarts 
footer series suggestions + inventory : contains what pulled + money spent (
    chars that pulled b4 album 
setPulledChar prolly change to array 
) 
random mascot random series



require("dotenv").config({path: '.env.local'});
does removing path break vercel. but not saying path breaks everything else lol.. 

my fav series (based on average overall pulls): 
S tier 
sp mare of animals 
sp candy monster town 
a tier
